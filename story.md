# a cheesy love story 

*Renee POV* 

  His brown chocolate eyes, the way he sweeps his hair to the side and his laugh... 
I swear, he is going to be the death of me. 
How can one be so... *perfect*? 
He is so funny, smart and kind. 
*What is this boy doing to me?* 
I have never fallen this hard before... 
This boy must really have a huge effect on me.


  "Renee? Are you still there?" Jackson questioned.

  "Sorry, spaced out for a moment," I replied. 
That was close. 
I should probably pay attention to his words instead of his face. 

*Jackson POV* 

  She is so focused, the way she scrunches her eyes as she thinks of ideas for our project, and her tiny giggles whenever I crack a lame joke. 
The way she is constantly deep in thought and constantly asks these deep questions,
all those traits just maker her seem... *perfect* 
I am so thankful that the teacher paired us together for this project, this way, I get to talk to her more. 
She is really pretty too... 
I cannot comprehend her inner *and* outer beauty. 
I am falling so hard for this girl... 
*What is this girl doing to me?* 

*Renee POV* 

  After school, while walking to the train station, I was lost in my sea of thoughts. 
"Hey," a voice came from behind me, followed by a tap on my shoulder. 
Turning around, I realised it was him, Jackson, the guy I am head over heels for. 

  "So..." Jackson started. "Do you know what kind of guys and food that Jessica likes? I mean, she's you're best friend after all." 
Upon hearing those words, my heart shattered into a million pieces. 
He likes my best friend, not me... 
I guess this is where everything in life goes downhill just like those in the books that I read.

  "Yeah, she likes tall and witty guys. Her favourite food is probably cake, especially matcha," I lied, hoping that he would fall for it. 

  "Oh, okay, thanks, Renee! Bye!" Jackson replied with a smile. 
I could obviously hear the tinge of sadness in his voice. 
He probably thought that he did not classify as a guy that Jessica would like. 
Maybe I should give up on this stupid crush. 
But how could I, he has everything I want in a guy. 
The fact that I cannot get him makes me like him even more. 
Why am I reacting this way? 
I should probably tell Jessica that Jackson likes her. 

*Jackson POV* 

  I regret asking her that question but I had to, if not she would think that I like her. 
I doubt that she would like a guy like me... 
I have annoyed her multiple of times and given her dozens of montone replies to her texts. 
But she will not return my feelings back anyways... 
At least I got to talk to her and hear her voice one more time before the day ends.
Will confessing ruin our friendship?
Wait, I was going to do something, what was it, what was it... 
Right, I have to ask Jessica if Renee likes me back. 
I am pretty sure she will say that Renee does not like me back. 
Tomorrow, I will meet up with Jessica, buy her a matcha cake and ask her the question. 
What if Renee sees us and gets the wrong idea?
I hope not.
I am so nervous... Wish me luck. 

*Renee POV* 

  "Jessie, I've got some news to tell you. Whether it's good or bad is really up to you," I started. 
"Jackson has a crush on you. I think he would uh confess to you soon?" 
I sound too hesitant, she is not going to believe me. 

"But isn't he your crush? 
I thought you weren't over him yet? 
How do you feel about this? 
Should I stop takling to him? 
This is obviously bad news oh my gosh. 
Are you heartbroken by this?
Do you want to eat ice cream? 
Will that make you feel better..." Jessica basically blurted out. 
What did I do to deserve a friend like her. 
No wonder he likes her. 
I get it now. 
Maybe I should start acting like her. 
This way, he would notice me and like me too. 
No, that is a really terrible way to get him to like me, he would definitely be able to tell that I am trying to get his attention.  
In repsonse to Jessica's question, I simply said that I was fine and told her not to worry about it. 

*Jessica POV*

Ren seems so heartbroken... 
The light in her eyes has faded. 
I know Jackson does not like me but it pains me not being able to tell Renee the truth.
